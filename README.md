This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. 
It includes sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects and Contact. 
I have showcased my basic web development projects such as Virtual Art Gallery and Dream Vacation Page. 
This project represents my learning journey as a first year BTech student exploring programming and web technologies. 
I will keep improving the website as I learn new skills like JavaScript and C programming. Thank you
